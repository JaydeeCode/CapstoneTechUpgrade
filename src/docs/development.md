# Project Documentation - Development Log

**Description:** This document tracks the daily progress of the project, focusing on the development process, learning experiences, and troubleshooting. It includes detailed notes on implementation steps, challenges encountered, and solutions found.

**Definitions:**

- **Project** - Disaster Mapping System: This is the system we developed during our Capstone Project 2. It is a full-stack web application designed for offline use. I will be rebuilding this project with a focus on the frontend.

## Development Logs

### April 11, 2025

**Task 1. Choose a Hosting Platform**

**Description:** Our Capstone project originally utilized PHP and MySQL for backend integration, and we deployed our website on webhost000. Unfortunately, due to inactivity on my webhost000 account, the website was removed, and I can no longer retrieve the files. Fortunately, I have backup files available.

**Output:** I tested deploying the website on Heroku App to integrate the backend and found that using Dynos incurs a cost of $0.10 per hour. Since this project is solely for my portfolio, I am looking for a completely free hosting platform. I also explored other hosting options but realized that I would need to spend time understanding their documentation. Given that I am currently focusing on frontend development, I will set aside the backend for now and concentrate on building the frontend from scratch.

**Decision:** Use Github Pages. It's free, easy to setup, and suitable for static website.

**Task Duration:** 20 mins.

**Task 2. Identify technologies to use for rebuilding my project**

**Description:** I have experience building static websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React (installed via Vite). However, I'm eager to explore other modern technologies to further enhance my skills while reworking this project.

**Output:** I watched a TikTok live session featuring an experienced coder who uses Shadcn components to speed up his development process. After reviewing the Shadcn documentation, I found a wide range of UI components available for this project. The documentation is clear and offers various options for installation and usage. I noticed that the default installation includes TypeScript. Since I am familiar with TypeScript and many developers in the JavaScript ecosystem (based on social media platforms like Reddit, Facebook, and TikTok) recommend using it, I will give it a try.

**Decision:**

- Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript
- Technologies: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Vite, npm, Git, GitHub

**Task Duration:** 26 mins.

**Task 3. Install and Configure Shadcn/UI for Vite**

**Description:** The Shadcn installation documentation provides a project creation template for React + TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Follow the installation guide available at https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite.

**Output:** A project template featuring React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, along with a successful installation of Shadcn and the addition of the `login-04` component as the initial component.

**Decision:** Given my successful utilization of Shadcn, I am confident in my ability to work effectively on this project.

**Task Duration:** 30 mins.

**Task 4. Fix `login-04` design**

**Description:** After adding `login-04` component from Task 3, I noticed that the login form UI is not displaying properly. I need to figure out what causing this problem.

**Output:**
