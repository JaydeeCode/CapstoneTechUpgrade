**Task 1. Choose a Hosting Platform**

**Description:** Our Capstone project originally utilized PHP and MySQL for backend integration, and we deployed our website on webhost000. Unfortunately, due to inactivity on my webhost000 account, the website was removed, and I can no longer retrieve the files. Fortunately, I have backup files available.

**Output:** I tested deploying the website on Heroku App to integrate the backend and found that using Dynos incurs a cost of $0.10 per hour. Since this project is solely for my portfolio, I am looking for a completely free hosting platform. I also explored other hosting options but realized that I would need to spend time understanding their documentation. Given that I am currently focusing on frontend development, I will set aside the backend for now and concentrate on building the frontend from scratch.

**Decision:** Use Github Pages. It's free, easy to setup, and suitable for static website.

**Task Duration:** 20 mins.
