**Task 1. Choose a Hosting Platform**

**Description:** Our Capstone project originally utilized PHP and MySQL for backend integration, and we deployed our website on webhost000. Unfortunately, due to inactivity on my webhost000 account, the website was removed, and I can no longer retrieve the files. Fortunately, I have backup files available.

**Output:** I tested deploying the website on Heroku App to integrate the backend. While I was able to deploy it, I encountered an error because the Dynos were disabled. I discovered that using Dynos incurs a cost of $0.10 per hour. However, I am looking for a completely free hosting platform since this project is solely for my portfolio. As I am currently focusing on frontend development, I will set aside the backend for now and concentrate on building the frontend from scratch.

**Decision:** Use Github Pages.

**Task Duration:** 20 mins.
